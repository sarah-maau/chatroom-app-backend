# chatroom-app-backend ðŸš€

## functional overview

## what is this project ?
The chatroom is real-time web chat application to be realized with modern web technologies.
- several chat rooms are available
- users can read the last 10 messages in the room when they enter it
- user can read new messages from other users
- user can write and send new messages
- user can see a list of available chat rooms
- user can join and leave a chat room
- user can see a list of users in a chatroom
- user can create a chat room by giving it a name

## how the project was designed ?
On the back side, I used socket io to manage the websocket. To have rooms already open, with messages and users, I set up a database and websevices to retrieve and display it.
To go further, I could have connected the users actions with MongoDB for data persistence.
